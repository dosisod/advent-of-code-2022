# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) in AWK, because why not?
Some GNU AWK functions are used for simplicity/elegance.

Files are in the format `DAY-PART.awk`, for example, day 1 part 2 would be `1-2.awk`.
Each challenge can be ran like so:

```
$ awk -f days/DAY-PART.awk input.txt
```

Where `input.txt` is the input for the corresponding day.
